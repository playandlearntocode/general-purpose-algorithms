# FUN WITH FLOOD FILL

Sample program for counting islands on an input image (map) using flood fill algorithm in python.

Green areas on maps represent islands and white areas represent sea.

Sea is also assumed around the map area.

The algorithm takes the PNG image as input and returns a number of islands detected on the image.
